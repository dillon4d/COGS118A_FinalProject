# COGS118A_FinalProject

### Final project for COGS118A Supervised Machine Learning course

This project examines multiple supervised machine learning algorithms used to solve classification problems. In this project, I perform an empirical analysis and comparison between the supervised learning methods: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and decision trees. Performance is measured across multiple trials and datasets for each classifier.  
  
#### Classification problems explored: 

 - Heart Disease
 - Mushrooms
 - Drug Consumption
 
#### Classification notebooks are comprised of:
 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - GridSearchCV
  - Three separate trials
  - Optimal parameter tuning
  - Trial results
